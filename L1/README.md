## L1 - Introduction

An explanation of the web as it relates to the internet

- The Internet is a network of connected computers.

- Internet is governed by a system of standards and rules and not by any single company.

- Basic Purposes of Internet is to share information

- Standardized methods (for e.g. Emails, FTP) for transferring data or documents over a network are known as protocols.

- The Web was originally called the World Wide Web, thus the `www` in site addresses.

- The Web is regarded as a subset of the internet.

- It is just one of many ways information can be transferred over networked computers.

- It is unique in that it allows documents to be linked to one another using hypertext links - thus forming a huge "web" of connected information.

- The Web uses a protocol called `HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)`.

A Server

- is the Software(not the computer itself).

- allows the computer to communicate with other computers.

- The role of server software is to wait for a request for information, then retrieve and send that information as quickly as possible.

In order for a computer to be part of the Web, it must be running special web server software that allows it to handle Hypertext Transfer Protocol transactions.

Web Servers are also called "HTTP Servers."
